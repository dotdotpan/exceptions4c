= Introduction =

Bring the power of exceptions to your C applications with this tiny, portable exception handling framework for C.

This library provides you a simple set of keywords (macros, actually) which map the semantics of exception handling you're probably already used to:

    * `try`
    * `catch`
    * `finally`
    * `throw`
