== Throwing exceptions ==

Creates a new instance of the specified type of exception and then throws it. The provided message is copied into the thrown exception, so it can be freely deallocated. If `NULL` is passed, then the default message for that type of exception will be used. 

When an exception is thrown, the exception handling framework looks for the appropriate [catch] block that can handle the exception. The system unwinds the call chain of the program and executes the [finally] blocks it finds. 

When no [catch] block is able to handle an exception, the system eventually gets to the main function of the program. This situation is called an _*uncaught exception*_.
