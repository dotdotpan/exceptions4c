#summary Acquiring and disposing resources

= Using Resources =

When using resources, sometimes the part of the code that acquires the resource is far away in _space_ (in source code) or _time_ (in runtime) from the part that disposes it. But very often, resources are consecutively:
 # *acquired*
 # *used*
 # and then *disposed*, in a row

In such times, manual acquisition (before) and disposal (after), before and after the real deal (actually _making use_ of the resource), feels like a cumbersome and tedious bookkeeping task.

This pattern goes like this:

 # trying to acquire the resource
 # failed? then take the appropriate actions
 # succeeded? then use the resource
 # when done, dispose the resource
