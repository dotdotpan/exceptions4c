#summary Drawbacks and other notes

= Drawbacks =

 * None of the blocks can be _broken_. You cannot use neither `return`, `goto` or `break` to jump out of any `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `with` or `use` blocks. You can `throw` exceptions, though.
 * Exceptions are _unchecked_, so you should wrap your application's main loop with a _catch-all_ block if you don't want your application exiting when an exception pops out `main`.
