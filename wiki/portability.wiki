This library should compile in any good old C compiler. It uses nothing but standard C functions. In order to use exceptions4c you have to drop the two files (`except4c.h` and `except4c.c`) in your project and remember to `#include` the header file from your code. 

In case your application uses threads, `exceptions4c` relies on pthreads, the *POSIX* application programming interface for writing multithreaded applications. This _API_ is available for most operating systems and platforms.
