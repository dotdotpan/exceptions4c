= `finally` keyword =

`finally` blocks are optional code blocks that must be preceded by `try`, `with/use` or `using` blocks. It is allowed to place, at most, one `finally` block.

The `finally` block can determine the completeness of the exception-aware block through the function `e4c_get_status`. The thrown exception (if any) can also be accessed through the function `e4c_get_exception`.

{{{
try{
    ...
}finally{
    switch( e4c_get_status() ){

        case e4c_succeeded:
            ...
            break;

        case e4c_recovered:
            ...
            break;

        case e4c_failed:
            ...
            break;
    }
}
}}}

The `finally` block will be executed only once. The only possible way to be executed again would be by [retry retrying] the entire `try` block.
